# Flow Analysis

The Code Pattern Analyzer includes powerful flow analysis capabilities that help you understand the internal structure and behavior of your code at a deeper level.

## Overview

Flow analysis examines how code executes and how data moves through your program. This analysis provides insights into potential issues like unreachable code, uninitialized variables, and complex control flow structures that might be difficult to maintain.

Our flow analysis consists of two main components:

1. **Control Flow Analysis**: Examines the paths that might be taken through your code during execution
2. **Data Flow Analysis**: Tracks how data values are defined, used, and propagate through your code

## Control Flow Analysis

Control flow analysis creates a graph representation of all possible execution paths through your code. This helps identify:

- Dead/unreachable code blocks
- Potential infinite loops
- Complex branching structures
- All possible execution paths through a function

The control flow analyzer creates a detailed control flow graph (CFG) for each function, which can be visualized to help you understand the structure of your code.

### Key Features

- Generation of control flow graphs for each function
- Detection of unreachable code
- Identification of potential infinite loops
- Analysis of function exit paths (normal returns vs. exceptions)
- Visualization of control flow structures
- Integration with complexity metrics

## Data Flow Analysis

Data flow analysis tracks how variables are defined and used throughout your code. This helps identify:

- Undefined variables
- Unused variables
- Variables potentially used before initialization
- Definition-use chains (connecting where variables are defined to where they're used)

The data flow analyzer uses the control flow graph to track how data moves through different execution paths in your program.

### Key Features

- Variable definition and usage tracking
- Reaching definitions analysis
- Detection of undefined variables
- Identification of unused variables
- Analysis of potentially uninitialized variables
- Visualization of data flow
- Live variable analysis

## Usage

You can use the flow analysis tools through the command line:

```bash
# Run both control and data flow analysis
python run_flow_analysis.py /path/to/code

# Run just control flow analysis
python run_flow_analysis.py /path/to/code -a control

# Run just data flow analysis
python run_flow_analysis.py /path/to/code -a data

# Analyze a specific function
python run_flow_analysis.py /path/to/code --function my_function

# Generate visualizations
python run_flow_analysis.py /path/to/code --visualize
```

## Integration with Other Features

Flow analysis integrates with other Code Pattern Analyzer features:

- **Code Complexity Metrics**: Control flow information is used to calculate cyclomatic complexity and cognitive complexity
- **Design Pattern Detection**: Flow analysis helps identify the behavioral aspects of design patterns
- **Architectural Analysis**: Flow analysis can reveal dependencies between components and layers
- **Visualization**: Interactive visualizations help you understand flow analysis results

## Technical Details

The flow analysis functionality is built on:

- Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) parsing using tree-sitter
- Graph-based representations of code structure
- Static analysis algorithms for control and data flow
- NetworkX for graph algorithms
- Matplotlib for generating visualizations

## Example Output

### Control Flow Graph

Control flow graphs show the structure of your code with nodes representing code blocks and edges representing possible execution paths:

- Entry points (green)
- Exit points (red)
- Branches (orange)
- Loops (purple)
- Normal statements (blue)
- Function calls (cyan)

The visualization highlights potential issues such as unreachable nodes or potential infinite loops.

### Data Flow Visualization

Data flow visualizations show how variables are defined and used:

- Variable definitions (blue)
- Variable uses (purple)
- Definition-use chains (dashed lines)

The visualization helps you understand how data propagates through your code and identify potential issues with data flow.

## Future Enhancements

We're planning to enhance our flow analysis capabilities with:

- Taint analysis for security vulnerability detection
- More advanced alias analysis
- Call graph generation and analysis
- Inter-procedural data flow analysis
- More sophisticated visualization options
- IDE integration for real-time flow analysis feedback
