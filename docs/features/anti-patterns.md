# Architectural Anti-Pattern Detection

This document describes the architectural anti-pattern detection capabilities of the Code Pattern Analyzer.

## Overview

Architectural anti-patterns are problematic structural patterns that violate good design principles and lead to maintainability, extensibility, or scalability issues. The Code Pattern Analyzer can detect these anti-patterns and provide recommendations for addressing them.

## Anti-Patterns Detected

The Code Pattern Analyzer currently detects the following architectural anti-patterns:

### 1. Tight Coupling

Tight coupling occurs when components are excessively dependent on each other, leading to:

- High change impact (changes in one component affect many others)
- Difficulty in testing components in isolation
- Reduced reusability of components
- Challenges in understanding the system due to complex interactions

The analyzer detects:
- Components with high afferent coupling (many incoming dependencies)
- Components with high efferent coupling (many outgoing dependencies)
- Bidirectional dependencies between components
- Highly connected component clusters

### 2. Dependency Cycles

Dependency cycles occur when components form circular dependencies, leading to:

- Tight coupling between components in the cycle
- Difficulty understanding the component relationships
- Challenges in testing components independently
- Potential for infinite recursion or deadlocks
- Barrier to modular development and deployment

The analyzer detects:
- Simple cycles (A → B → A)
- Complex cycles (A → B → C → A)
- Components that participate in multiple cycles

### 3. Architectural Erosion

Architectural erosion occurs when the implemented architecture diverges from the intended design, leading to:

- Violation of architectural boundaries
- Deterioration of the intended structure over time
- Increasing difficulty in maintaining the system
- Cross-cutting dependencies that bypass architectural layers/boundaries

The analyzer detects:
- Violations of layer boundaries in layered architectures
- Domain components depending on adapters in hexagonal architectures
- Direct dependencies between services in microservices
- Other architectural style-specific violations

### 4. God Component

God component (also known as God Class or Blob) occurs when a component takes on too many responsibilities, becoming bloated and violating the single responsibility principle:

- Excessive size and complexity
- High coupling with many other components
- Many incoming and outgoing dependencies
- Difficulty understanding, testing, and modifying the component
- Inhibited code reuse due to heavy interdependence

The analyzer detects:
- Components with excessive dependencies
- Components with many methods/functions
- Large components (by lines of code)
- Components that seem to have multiple responsibilities

## Using Anti-Pattern Detection

### CLI Usage

You can use the anti-pattern detection through the command-line interface:

```bash
code-pattern-analyzer anti-patterns <directory>
```

Options:
- `--format` or `-f`: Output format (json, text, html)
- `--output` or `-o`: Output file path
- `--extensions` or `-e`: File extensions to analyze

Example:
```bash
code-pattern-analyzer anti-patterns src --format html --output report.html
```

### Standalone Script

You can also use the standalone script:

```bash
python run_anti_pattern_analysis.py <directory> [output_format]
```

Example:
```bash
python run_anti_pattern_analysis.py src html > report.html
```

## Integrating with Your Workflow

The anti-pattern detection can be integrated into your development workflow:

1. **Code Reviews**: Run the anti-pattern analysis before code reviews to identify potential issues.
2. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Add the anti-pattern detection to your CI/CD pipeline to prevent anti-patterns from being introduced.
3. **Regular Audits**: Periodically audit your codebase for anti-patterns to maintain architectural integrity.

## Interpretation of Results

The anti-pattern detection results include:

- **Overall Severity**: A score from 0.0 to 1.0 indicating the severity of anti-patterns in the codebase.
- **Summary**: A human-readable summary of the anti-patterns detected.
- **Recommendations**: Suggestions for addressing the detected anti-patterns.
- **Details**: Specific instances of anti-patterns with their locations and severity.

### Severity Levels

- **0.0-0.3**: Minor issues that may not significantly impact maintainability.
- **0.3-0.6**: Moderate issues that should be addressed to prevent future maintenance problems.
- **0.6-1.0**: Severe issues that likely impact maintainability and should be addressed promptly.

## Visualizations

When using the HTML output format, the anti-pattern detection includes visualizations that help understand the anti-patterns:

- **Dependency Graphs**: Visualizing component dependencies with anti-patterns highlighted.
- **Cycle Diagrams**: Visualizing dependency cycles.
- **Heatmaps**: Showing "hot spots" of architectural anti-patterns.

## Best Practices for Addressing Anti-Patterns

### Tight Coupling

- Apply the Interface Segregation Principle to create smaller, more focused interfaces.
- Use the Dependency Inversion Principle to depend on abstractions rather than concretions.
- Introduce intermediary components or facades to reduce direct dependencies.

### Dependency Cycles

- Break cycles by applying the Dependency Inversion Principle.
- Extract shared functionality into a separate component that others can depend on.
- Use events or observer pattern to break tight coupling in cyclic dependencies.

### Architectural Erosion

- Create and document clear architectural boundaries, rules, and constraints.
- Implement regular architecture compliance checks in your CI/CD pipeline.
- Hold architecture review sessions for significant changes.

### God Component

- Apply the Single Responsibility Principle to break down god components.
- Use the Extract Class refactoring pattern to split responsibilities.
- Apply design patterns like Strategy, Observer, or Decorator to distribute responsibilities.
