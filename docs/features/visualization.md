# Advanced Visualization

The Code Pattern Analyzer includes sophisticated visualization capabilities that bring architectural patterns, code relationships, and potential issues to life through interactive, explorable visualizations.

## Key Visualization Types

### Force-Directed Component Graphs

\![Force-Directed Graph](../images/force_directed_graph.png)

Our force-directed graph visualization provides an intuitive view of components and their relationships:

- **Interactive Physics**: Components arrange themselves naturally based on their connections
- **Intuitive Grouping**: Components can be grouped by layer, module, or type
- **Relationship Highlighting**: Easily identify dependencies and violations
- **Interactive Controls**: Filter, zoom, and explore complex architectures
- **Component Details**: Click on any component to see detailed information

### Architectural Style Visualizations

Each architectural style has specialized visualizations that highlight its unique characteristics:

#### Layered Architecture

\![Layered Architecture](../images/layered_architecture.png)

- Clear visual separation between layers
- Directional dependencies showing information flow
- Violation highlighting for architectural integrity issues
- Layer composition statistics and key components

#### Hexagonal Architecture

- Core domain visualization at center
- Ports shown as boundaries
- Adapters connecting to external systems
- Clear separation of concerns visualization

#### Clean Architecture

- Concentric circles showing dependency rule
- Entity, use case, interface, and framework layers
- Directional dependencies pointing inward
- Violation detection for the dependency rule

### Anti-Pattern Visualizations

Anti-pattern visualizations help identify problematic code structures:

- **Dependency Cycles**: Circular dependency visualization
- **God Components**: Size and connection visualization for oversized components
- **Tight Coupling**: Network density and connection strength indicators
- **Architectural Erosion**: Layer violation highlighting
- **Severity Indicators**: Color-coded warnings based on impact

## Visualization Features

### Interactive Exploration

All visualizations are fully interactive, allowing you to:

- Zoom in/out to focus on specific areas
- Pan across large codebases
- Click on components to see details
- Hover over connections to understand relationships
- Filter by component type, layer, or other attributes
- Group components by various criteria

### Bidirectional Code Linking

Our visualizations connect directly to your code:

- Click on visualization components to see the corresponding code
- Navigate from code to its architectural representation
- View code context within the visualization
- Understand how code implements architectural patterns

### Customization Options

Tailor visualizations to your needs:

- Adjust layout algorithms for different perspectives
- Customize color schemes and visual styles
- Choose detail levels for different audiences
- Save and share custom visualization configurations

## Using Visualizations

### Command Line

Generate visualizations using the provided scripts:

```bash
# Generate a force-directed component visualization
python run_component_visualization.py /path/to/project --style layered

# Analyze and visualize architectural anti-patterns
python run_anti_pattern_analysis.py /path/to/project

# Compare different architectural approaches
python compare_architectures.py

# Standard CLI command
code-pattern visualize /path/to/project --pattern layered_architecture
```

### Web Interface

The web interface provides an intuitive way to generate and explore visualizations:

1. Start the web interface:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/start_web_ui.sh
   ```

2. Navigate to http://localhost:3000 in your browser
3. Upload your project or select an existing one
4. Click "Visualize" to generate interactive visualizations

## Sharing and Exporting

Share your insights with others:

```bash
# Create a portable visualization bundle
python view_visualization.py --bundle reports/component_visualization.html --output-dir ./portable_visualizations
```

## Best Practices

- **Regular Visualization**: Generate visualizations periodically as your code evolves to track architectural drift
- **Team Reviews**: Use visualizations in code reviews and architectural discussions
- **Refactoring Guide**: Let visualizations guide your refactoring priorities
- **Documentation**: Include visualizations in architectural documentation
- **Onboarding**: Use visualizations to help new team members understand the codebase

## Technical Implementation

Built with modern visualization technologies:

- **D3.js**: For interactive data-driven visualizations
- **Chart.js**: For statistical charts
- **HTML5/CSS3**: For responsive layouts
- **SVG**: For vector graphics
- **JavaScript**: For dynamic interactions

## Future Development

Our visualization roadmap includes:

- 3D visualization capabilities
- Timeline views showing architectural evolution
- IDE integration for real-time visualization
- Enhanced filtering and exploration tools
- More specialized visualizations for additional architectural patterns
