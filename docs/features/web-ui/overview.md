# Web UI Overview

## Introduction

The Code Pattern Analyzer Web UI provides a user-friendly interface for analyzing code, visualizing patterns, and managing analysis results. It extends the command-line functionality with an intuitive graphical interface that makes it easier to work with complex codebases and understand architectural patterns.

## Purpose

The Web UI addresses several key needs:

1. **Accessibility**: Makes the pattern analyzer accessible to users without command-line experience
2. **Visualization**: Provides interactive visualizations of analysis results
3. **Project Management**: Offers tools for managing multiple files and analysis sessions
4. **Collaboration**: Enables sharing and discussing analysis results

## Core Features

### Code Analysis

- **Direct Code Input**: Paste code snippets directly for quick analysis
- **File Upload**: Upload individual files or complete projects 
- **Language Detection**: Automatic language detection for proper parsing
- **Pattern Selection**: Choose which patterns to detect
- **Analysis Configuration**: Customize analysis settings

### Results Visualization

- **Pattern Overview**: Summary of detected patterns with counts and locations
- **Interactive Charts**: Visual representation of pattern distribution
- **Code View**: Source code with pattern annotations and highlighting
- **Detail Views**: In-depth information about each detected pattern

### Project Management

- **Project Creation**: Group related files for comprehensive analysis
- **File Organization**: Manage files within projects
- **Analysis History**: Track changes over time
- **Saved Results**: Store and retrieve previous analyses

## User Interface

The Web UI is designed with a clean, modern interface that follows these principles:

- **Intuitive Navigation**: Clear menu structure and breadcrumbs
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and tablet devices
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Shows relevant information at appropriate times
- **Consistent Layout**: Maintains familiar patterns throughout the interface

## Accessing the Web UI

The Web UI can be accessed in several ways:

### Local Development

```bash
# Start the backend server
python -m src.web.app

# Start the frontend development server
cd web_ui/frontend
npm start
```

### Production Deployment

For production use, the Web UI can be deployed as a containerized application:

```bash
# Using Docker Compose
docker-compose up -d
```

The Web UI will be available at http://localhost:3000 by default.

## Integration Points

The Web UI integrates with several other components:

1. **Core Analyzer**: Uses the analyzer engine for pattern detection
2. **Visualization Module**: Leverages visualization capabilities for interactive charts
3. **Remote Repositories**: Can import code from Git repositories (planned)
4. **CI/CD Systems**: Can integrate with development pipelines (planned)

## Benefits

- **Improved Accessibility**: Makes sophisticated code analysis available to more users
- **Enhanced Understanding**: Visual presentation aids comprehension of complex patterns
- **Streamlined Workflow**: Simplifies the process of analyzing large codebases
- **Collaboration**: Facilitates sharing insights among team members
- **Documentation**: Helps generate architectural documentation from code analysis
