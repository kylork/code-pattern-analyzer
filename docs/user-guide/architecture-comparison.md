# Architecture Comparison Tool

The Code Pattern Analyzer includes a powerful tool for comparing different architectural styles side by side. This feature is particularly useful for educational purposes, architecture evaluation, and team discussions about system design.

## Overview

The architecture comparison tool:

1. Generates example projects for multiple architectural styles
2. Analyzes each project to create visualizations
3. Produces an interactive HTML page comparing the architectures
4. Provides detailed information about each style's characteristics

## Using the Comparison Tool

```bash
# Generate a comparison with default settings
python compare_architectures.py

# Specify custom output location
python compare_architectures.py --output ./my_comparisons/architecture_comparison.html

# Keep the generated example projects for further examination
python compare_architectures.py --keep-examples
```

## What's Included in the Comparison

The generated comparison page includes:

### 1. Architectural Style Overview

For each supported architectural style (Layered, Hexagonal, Clean):
- Key characteristics and principles
- Benefits and advantages
- Ideal use cases
- Visual representation

### 2. Structure Comparison

Interactive tabs showing the directory structure for each architecture, with explanations of how components are organized and how dependencies flow.

### 3. Feature Comparison Table

A detailed comparison table showing how each architecture stacks up against criteria such as:
- Separation of concerns
- Isolation of business logic
- Testability
- UI independence
- Framework independence
- Database independence
- Implementation complexity
- Learning curve

### 4. Visualizations

Interactive visualizations of each architectural style, generated from the example projects, showing:
- Component relationships
- Dependency directions
- Layer boundaries
- Interface points

### 5. Selection Guidance

Clear guidance on when to choose each architectural style, based on:
- Project requirements
- Team expertise
- Business domain complexity
- Long-term maintenance needs
- Integration requirements

## Educational Uses

The architecture comparison tool is an excellent resource for:

1. **Training New Developers**
   - Understand architectural patterns through examples
   - See concrete implementations of architectural principles
   - Learn about dependency management

2. **Architecture Decision Making**
   - Evaluate different architectural approaches for new projects
   - Make informed decisions based on visual comparisons
   - Understand trade-offs between different styles

3. **Classroom Instruction**
   - Provide visual aids for teaching software architecture
   - Demonstrate practical implementations of theoretical concepts
   - Allow students to explore architectural differences

## Example Workflow

Here's a typical workflow for using the architecture comparison tool:

1. Generate a comparison:
   ```bash
   python compare_architectures.py --output ./my_comparison.html --keep-examples
   ```

2. Open the generated HTML file in a browser to explore the comparisons.

3. Review the example projects to see the implementation details:
   ```bash
   cd /tmp/architecture_examples_*/layered
   ls -la
   ```

4. Modify the examples to experiment with architectural variations.

5. Run the analyzer on your modified examples:
   ```bash
   python run_code_pattern_linkage.py /tmp/architecture_examples_*/layered --style layered
   ```

6. Use the insights from the comparison to inform your own architectural decisions.

## Extending the Comparison Tool

You can extend the architecture comparison tool by:

1. Adding more architectural styles to the `create_example_project.py` script
2. Customizing the HTML template in `src/templates/architecture_comparison.html`
3. Adding more comparison criteria to the feature table
4. Including additional visualizations or metrics
