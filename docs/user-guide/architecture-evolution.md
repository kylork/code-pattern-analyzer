# Architecture Evolution Simulator

The Code Pattern Analyzer includes a powerful simulation tool that demonstrates how software architecture evolves over time as requirements change, technical debt accumulates, and refactoring occurs. This educational tool helps developers understand the long-term impacts of architectural decisions.

## Overview

The Architecture Evolution Simulator:

1. Simulates how different architectural styles develop over multiple years
2. Visualizes the changes in components, dependencies, and code structure
3. Tracks metrics like complexity, technical debt, maintainability, and scalability
4. Shows how real-world events impact software architecture
5. Provides interactive exploration of architectural evolution stages

## Using the Simulator

```bash
# Run a basic simulation with default parameters
python simulate_architecture_evolution.py

# Specify custom output location
python simulate_architecture_evolution.py --output ./my_simulations/evolution.html

# Simulate a specific number of years
python simulate_architecture_evolution.py --years 8

# Start with a specific architecture type
python simulate_architecture_evolution.py --initial-architecture hexagonal

# Include special events
python simulate_architecture_evolution.py --event-scaling --event-security
```

## Simulation Parameters

The simulator accepts various parameters to customize the evolution scenario:

### Project Characteristics

- `--project-size`: Size of the project (1=Very Small, 5=Very Large)
- `--initial-architecture`: Starting architecture (monolith, layered, hexagonal, clean, microservices)
- `--team-experience`: Experience level of the development team (1=Beginner, 5=Expert)

### Evolution Factors

- `--requirement-change-rate`: How quickly requirements change (1=Very Low, 5=Very High)
- `--tech-debt-tolerance`: Willingness to accept technical debt (1=Very Low, 5=Very High)
- `--refactoring-frequency`: How often refactoring occurs (1=Very Low, 5=Very High)

### Special Events

- `--event-scaling`: Include a rapid user growth event in year 2
- `--event-security`: Include a security incident in year 3
- `--event-acquisition`: Include a company acquisition in year 4
- `--event-pivot`: Include a business pivot in year 2

## Example Simulations

### Typical Enterprise Evolution

```bash
python simulate_architecture_evolution.py \
  --initial-architecture layered \
  --project-size 4 \
  --requirement-change-rate 3 \
  --tech-debt-tolerance 4 \
  --refactoring-frequency 2
```

This simulation shows how a typical enterprise application evolves from a layered architecture, with growing technical debt due to high tolerance and infrequent refactoring.

### Startup with Pivots

```bash
python simulate_architecture_evolution.py \
  --initial-architecture monolith \
  --project-size 2 \
  --team-experience 4 \
  --requirement-change-rate 5 \
  --event-pivot \
  --event-scaling
```

This simulation demonstrates the architecture evolution of a startup that experiences a business pivot and rapid user growth.

### Long-Term Sustainable Evolution

```bash
python simulate_architecture_evolution.py \
  --initial-architecture hexagonal \
  --project-size 3 \
  --team-experience 5 \
  --tech-debt-tolerance 1 \
  --refactoring-frequency 5 \
  --years 10
```

This simulation shows how a well-maintained hexagonal architecture evolves over a longer period with regular refactoring and low technical debt tolerance.

## Interactive Exploration

## Educational Applications

The Architecture Evolution Simulator is especially valuable for:

1. **Teaching Software Architecture**
   - Demonstrate how architectures evolve over time
   - Show the impact of different factors on architectural health
   - Illustrate the progression between architectural styles

2. **Project Planning**
   - Explore potential evolutionary paths for a project
   - Understand the long-term impacts of architectural decisions
   - Demonstrate the importance of refactoring and managing technical debt

3. **Team Training**
   - Help teams understand the consequences of their development practices
   - Illustrate why architectural governance matters
   - Show patterns of decay and improvement in software systems

## Using the Simulator with Other Tools

The Architecture Evolution Simulator works well with other Code Pattern Analyzer tools:

1. Use the **Example Project Generator** to create reference implementations:
   ```bash
   python create_example_project.py --style hexagonal
   ```

2. Use the **Architecture Comparison Tool** to compare different evolutionary paths:
   ```bash
   python compare_architectures.py
   ```

3. Use the **Code Pattern Analyzer** to validate your understanding:
   ```bash
   python run_code_pattern_linkage.py examples/hexagonal
   ```

## Analysis of Evolution Patterns

The simulator helps identify common evolution patterns such as:

1. **Technical Debt Accumulation**: Gradual increase in complexity and technical debt as requirements change
2. **Architectural Drift**: Progressive deviation from the initial architecture
3. **Refactoring Impact**: How regular refactoring helps maintain architectural integrity
4. **Event Disruption**: How unexpected events can force architectural changes
5. **Transition Points**: When one architectural style evolves into another

By experimenting with different parameters, you can gain insights into how these patterns play out in different scenarios and learn strategies for managing architectural evolution effectively.
