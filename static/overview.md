# Code Pattern Analyzer

## What is it?

The Code Pattern Analyzer is a tool that helps developers understand complex codebases by visualizing their architecture and identifying design patterns.

## Key Features

- **Architectural Pattern Detection**: Automatically identify common architectural styles like layered, hexagonal, clean architecture, event-driven, and microservices
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Explore code architecture through interactive graph visualizations
- **Code-Pattern Linkage**: See the direct connection between architectural components and their code implementations
- **Multiple Languages**: Support for Python, JavaScript, and more
- **Easy to Use**: Simple web interface and command-line tools

## How to Use

1. **Start the GUI**: Run `python code_pattern_analyzer_gui.py`
2. **Select a Project**: Enter the path to your project directory
3. **Choose Analysis Options**: Select an architectural style to detect
4. **Run Analysis**: Click "Analyze Project" to start the analysis
5. **Explore Visualizations**: View and interact with generated visualizations

## Benefits

- **Understand Legacy Code**: Quickly grasp the structure of unfamiliar codebases
- **Identify Issues**: Spot architectural violations and anti-patterns
- **Improve Communication**: Share architectural visualizations with your team
- **Refactor Confidently**: Make changes with a better understanding of dependencies
- **Document Architecture**: Generate visual documentation of your code structure
