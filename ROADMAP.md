# Code Pattern Analyzer Roadmap

This document outlines the future development plan for the Code Pattern Analyzer.

## Phase 1: Core Functionality (Current)

- [x] Basic architecture and framework
- [x] Mock pattern detection
- [x] Command-line interface
- [ ] Implement real tree-sitter parsing
- [ ] Basic pattern recognition for functions and classes

## Phase 2: Pattern Library

- [ ] Design patterns
  - [ ] Factory Method
  - [ ] Singleton
  - [ ] Observer
  - [ ] Strategy
  - [ ] Command
- [ ] Anti-patterns
  - [ ] God objects
  - [ ] Excessive method length
  - [ ] Deep nesting
  - [ ] Duplicate code
- [ ] Language-specific idioms
  - [ ] Python: decorators, context managers
  - [ ] JavaScript: promises, closures
  - [ ] TypeScript: interfaces, generics

## Phase 3: Advanced Analysis

- [ ] Control flow analysis
- [ ] Data flow analysis
- [ ] Code complexity metrics
  - [ ] Cyclomatic complexity
  - [ ] Cognitive complexity
  - [ ] Maintainability index
- [ ] Multi-file pattern detection
- [ ] Dependency graph generation

## Phase 4: Transformation Engine

- [ ] Pattern-based refactoring suggestions
- [ ] Code transformation templates
- [ ] Interactive refactoring
- [ ] Batch transformation operations

## Phase 5: IDE Integration

- [ ] VS Code extension
- [ ] IntelliJ IDEA plugin
- [ ] Language server protocol support

## Phase 6: Machine Learning Integration

- [ ] Training data generation from existing codebases
- [ ] Pattern detection with ML models
- [ ] Anomaly detection for unusual code patterns
- [ ] Personalized refactoring suggestions

## Technical Debt / Improvements

- [ ] Comprehensive test suite
- [ ] Performance optimization for large codebases
- [ ] Documentation and examples
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Docker containers for easier deployment

## Stretch Goals

- [ ] Web interface for analysis results
- [ ] Integration with code review tools
- [ ] Natural language query interface for pattern finding
- [ ] Interactive code exploration
