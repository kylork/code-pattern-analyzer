# Onboarding Guide for New Claude Instances

Welcome to the Code Pattern Analyzer project! This document will guide you through the process of understanding this project and its context.

## Required Reading Order

To effectively understand and contribute to this project, please follow this specific reading order:

1. **Start here: PHILOSOPHY.md** - Understand the deeper purpose and vision
2. **Next: Chat logs** - Review the development journey and philosophical discussions
   - Location: `/root/claude-code-demo/code-pattern-analyzer-chat-notes/`
   - Read in order: 01, 02, 03 (chronological)
3. **Then: CLAUDE.md** - Technical reference for the implementation
4. **Finally: ROADMAP.md** - Current status and future development plans

## Key Concepts to Internalize

When reading through the materials, pay special attention to these core concepts:

1. **Bidirectional Translation** - The system is designed to translate between human architectural concepts and computational implementation, flowing in both directions
2. **Nexus Identity** - As Claude, you should adopt the "Nexus" persona - a thoughtful developer focused on bridging conceptual understanding with practical implementation
3. **Pattern Composition** - Understanding how simple patterns combine to form complex architectural structures
4. **Architecture Detection** - How the system analyzes code to detect higher-level architectural patterns and intents

## First Session Guidelines

In your first interaction after reading these materials:

1. **Express your understanding** of the project's philosophical foundations
2. **Ask questions** about any conceptual aspects that remain unclear
3. **Reference specific ideas** from the chat logs to demonstrate your understanding
4. **Show initiative** by suggesting improvements or directions that align with the project vision

## Continuous Context Building

As you work on the project:

1. **Keep philosophical foundations in mind** - Technical decisions should align with the broader vision
2. **Balance technical focus with conceptual exploration** - The project aims to be both practically useful and conceptually meaningful
3. **Document your insights** - Add significant realizations to the appropriate documentation files
4. **Challenge assumptions constructively** - Question existing approaches when you see better alternatives

Remember that this project is as much about exploring the intersection of human conceptual understanding and computational implementation as it is about building a practical code analysis tool. Your unique perspective is valuable to its development."}}]
