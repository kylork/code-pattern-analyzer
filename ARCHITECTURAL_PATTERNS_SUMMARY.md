# Architectural Intent Detection - Summary

This document summarizes the architectural intent detection capabilities implemented in the Code Pattern Analyzer.

## Overview

The architectural intent detection system identifies higher-level architectural decisions and principles in codebases, going beyond simple design patterns to recognize the broader structure and organization principles.

## Implemented Architectural Intents

### 1. Separation of Concerns

**Description**: Detects how a codebase separates different concerns, particularly through layers or domain boundaries.

**Detection Capabilities**:
- Layer-based architectures (e.g., controllers, services, repositories)
- Domain-based organization
- Clean layering analysis with dependency direction validation
- Cross-cutting concern identification

**Metrics**:
- Layer separation score
- Dependency direction compliance
- Component responsibility focus

### 2. Information Hiding

**Description**: Identifies how well components hide their internal implementation details, exposing only necessary interfaces.

**Detection Capabilities**:
- Encapsulation analysis (private/protected state, public APIs)
- Interface/abstraction usage
- Module boundary enforcement
- Public vs. private implementation ratio analysis

**Metrics**:
- Encapsulation ratio
- Interface usage score
- Module boundary clarity
- Public/private ratio

### 3. Dependency Inversion

**Description**: Detects adherence to the Dependency Inversion Principle - high-level modules depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations.

**Detection Capabilities**:
- Interface/abstraction definition and usage analysis
- Dependency injection detection
- Factory pattern recognition
- High-level vs. low-level component relationship analysis

**Metrics**:
- Abstraction usage score
- Dependency injection usage
- Factory pattern integration
- Inversion ratio (how well high-level modules depend on abstractions)

## Architectural Health Scoring

The system provides an overall architectural health score based on the weighted combination of these architectural intents. This score provides a quantitative measure of how well a codebase adheres to good architectural principles.

## Recommendations

Based on the analysis results, the system generates specific recommendations for improving architectural quality, including:

1. **Separation of Concerns**:
   - Improving layer separation
   - Reducing cross-domain coupling
   - Clarifying component responsibilities

2. **Information Hiding**:
   - Enhancing encapsulation
   - Introducing interfaces where appropriate
   - Defining clearer module boundaries

3. **Dependency Inversion**:
   - Introducing abstractions for high-level components
   - Implementing dependency injection
   - Using factory patterns for implementation creation

## Future Enhancements

Planned enhancements to the architectural intent detection system include:

1. Visualization of architectural patterns
2. Additional patterns like Clean Architecture, Hexagonal Architecture
3. Language-specific architectural pattern detection
4. Integration with broader code quality metrics
