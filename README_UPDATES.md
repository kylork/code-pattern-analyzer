# Code Pattern Analyzer: Latest Updates

## New Features

We've recently added several major new features to the Code Pattern Analyzer:

### 1. Unified Command Interface

- **New Entry Point**: The `code_pattern_analyzer.py` script now serves as a unified entry point for all features
- **Integrated Analysis**: Run all analysis types with a single command
- **Format Options**: Generate reports in HTML, JSON, Text, or Markdown formats
- **Selective Analysis**: Run only the analysis types you need with the `--include` option

```bash
# Run a full analysis with all features
./code_pattern_analyzer.py analyze /path/to/project -o report.html

# Run only flow analysis and refactoring suggestions
./code_pattern_analyzer.py analyze /path/to/project -o report.html --include flow,refactoring
```

### 2. Interactive Dashboard

- **Visual Exploration**: A new interactive dashboard for exploring analysis results
- **Data Visualization**: Charts and graphs for complexity metrics and issue distribution
- **Real-time Filtering**: Filter and sort findings as needed
- **Code Preview**: View suggested code changes directly in the dashboard

```bash
# Start the interactive dashboard
./code_pattern_analyzer.py dashboard
```

### 3. VS Code Integration

- **Editor Integration**: Analyze your code without leaving your editor
- **Inline Highlighting**: Issues are highlighted directly in your code
- **Quick Fix Actions**: Apply suggested refactorings with a click
- **Real-time Analysis**: Get immediate feedback as you code

1. Install the extension from the VS Code Marketplace or build from source
2. Access features from the Command Palette or context menus
3. Configure behavior in VS Code settings

### 4. Interactive Refactoring

- **Guided Refactoring**: The refactoring module now supports interactive sessions
- **Code Preview**: See before/after comparisons before applying changes
- **Batch Application**: Apply multiple refactorings in one go
- **Editor Integration**: Edit suggested refactorings before applying

```bash
# Start an interactive refactoring session
code-pattern refactoring interactive /path/to/project
```

### 5. Comprehensive Documentation

- **Integrated Usage Guide**: Learn how to combine tools effectively
- **VS Code Integration Guide**: Get the most out of the editor integration
- **API Documentation**: Integrate with your own tools and workflows
- **Example Workflows**: Follow complete example workflows from analysis to improvement

## Usage Updates

### Integrated Workflow

The new unified command interface makes it easy to run a complete analysis workflow:

```bash
# Run a comprehensive analysis
./code_pattern_analyzer.py analyze /path/to/project -o analysis.html

# Explore results in the dashboard
./code_pattern_analyzer.py dashboard

# Apply refactoring suggestions interactively  
code-pattern refactoring interactive /path/to/project

# Verify improvements with another analysis
./code_pattern_analyzer.py analyze /path/to/project -o improved.html
```

### Configuration

Configure the tools with a YAML file:

```yaml
# config.yml
analysis:
  include:
    - patterns
    - flow
    - complexity
    - refactoring
  exclude_dirs:
    - node_modules
    - build
    - dist

refactoring:
  min_impact: medium
  types:
    - EXTRACT_METHOD
    - FACTORY_METHOD
```

Then use it with the unified interface:

```bash
./code_pattern_analyzer.py analyze /path/to/project --config config.yml
```
