# Nexus Architectural Style System

## Overview

The Nexus Architectural Style System is a powerful capability within the Code Pattern Analyzer that creates a bridge between architectural intents (like Information Hiding and Dependency Inversion) and complete architectural styles (like Hexagonal Architecture and Microservices).

## Core Concept

Nexus recognizes that higher-level architectural styles are composed of multiple architectural intents implemented together in specific patterns. By first analyzing the fundamental architectural principles in a codebase and then seeing how they combine, Nexus can identify the overarching architectural approach.

## How It Works

1. **Individual Intent Detection**: First, Nexus analyzes code for fundamental architectural intents:
   - Separation of Concerns
   - Information Hiding
   - Dependency Inversion

2. **Component Relationship Analysis**: The system builds a graph of components and their relationships, tracking how they collaborate.

3. **Style Pattern Recognition**: Using both the intent results and component relationships, Nexus identifies higher-level architectural styles:
   - Hexagonal (Ports and Adapters) Architecture
   - Clean Architecture
   - Microservices Architecture

4. **Confidence Scoring**: Each architectural style receives a confidence score based on how well the codebase implements its key principles.

5. **Hybrid Architecture Detection**: Nexus can detect when a codebase uses a hybrid approach, combining elements from multiple architectural styles.

## Key Implementation Features

### Component Classification

Nexus classifies components into architectural roles:
- For Hexagonal: Domain, Ports, Adapters, Infrastructure
- For Clean: Entities, Use Cases, Interface Adapters, Frameworks
- For Microservices: Services, APIs, Databases, Containers

### Dependency Analysis

Nexus analyzes dependencies to verify they follow the rules of the architectural style:
- In Hexagonal: Adapters depend on Ports, not vice versa
- In Clean: Dependencies point inward
- In Microservices: Services should be loosely coupled

### Metric Generation

Detailed metrics help understand the architecture:
- Component distribution across architectural layers
- Dependency compliance ratios
- Service autonomy (for microservices)
- Interface usage statistics

## Practical Applications

- **Architecture Validation**: Verify that a codebase follows its intended architectural style
- **Technical Debt Detection**: Identify areas where architectural principles are compromised
- **Refactoring Guidance**: Generate specific recommendations to improve architectural alignment
- **Documentation Generation**: Create architectural diagrams and descriptions based on code analysis

## Supported Architectural Styles

The Nexus system currently detects:

1. **Hexagonal (Ports and Adapters) Architecture**
   - Domain, Ports, Adapters, Infrastructure
   - Dependency rules with adapters depending on ports

2. **Clean Architecture**
   - Entity, Use Cases, Interface Adapters, Frameworks
   - Dependency rules flowing inward

3. **Microservices Architecture**
   - Service boundaries, APIs, Databases
   - Service autonomy and containerization

4. **Event-Driven Architecture**
   - Event Producers, Consumers, Brokers
   - Asynchronous processing patterns
   - CQRS and Event Sourcing variants

## Future Extensions

Planned additions to the Nexus system include:
- Layered Architecture detection
- Serverless architecture patterns
- Reactive architecture patterns
- Backend-for-Frontend (BFF) patterns

## Philosophy

Nexus embodies a key philosophical principle of the Code Pattern Analyzer: creating a bidirectional translation between high-level architectural intent and implementation details. It allows us to reason about architectures in terms of both their conceptual models and their concrete implementations.
